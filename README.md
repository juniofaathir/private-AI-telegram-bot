# private-AI-telegram-bot
An AI LLM powered telegram bot that run on your local machine. 100% privacy and only CPU needed. But if you have GPU, it would decrease the inferencing time further. It means, faster at processing and generating the chat!

In addition, this telegram chatbot has some short-term memory. I'm setting it to remember only two chat before due to my potato laptop ðŸ¥” ðŸ’». If you have better machine with bigger & better RAM(Or even GPU!), you can modify itu to remember more chat history for better chatting experiences.

## Future Plan 
This project has a lot of room for improving. My plan for the future about this project is to create a lively, talkative, and smart digital AI asistant that can help any of user needs. Now I'm working on adding:
- [ ] Long-Term Memory using vector database
- [ ] Access to Google Calendar
- [ ] Access to internet for more knowledge and helping user to make decisions
